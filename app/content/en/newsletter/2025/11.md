### A Note from Me

I am thrilled to share that my kids will be arriving in Mexico City on December 1st! I can’t wait to pick them up and wrap my arms around them. It’s hard to believe that it’s been five months since I last hugged them at the Minneapolis airport. This journey has had its challenges, and I’ve missed many family dinners, soccer games, ballet performances, and gymnastics practices. I’ve also missed those precious bedtime stories, school pickups, and concerts.

I’m looking forward to creating new memories with my kids over the next 30 days! I feel incredibly grateful for my children and cherish my role as a dad. While I will miss all of you in December, I encourage you to stay committed and complete the workouts I send your way! The kids and I believe in you. I’ll be sharing updates on our adventures on Facebook, so be sure to keep an eye out. Scan the code below to follow my fitness journey on WhatsApp. **Stay savage!**

### Gym Update

I will be taking the month of December off, but don’t worry! You can still purchase programs to work out on your own during this time.

#### How Does That Work?

*You will be charged a program fee for any workout I write for you.*

##### For Those Coming to the Gym

Please purchase your sessions as soon as possible to give me enough time to prepare your workouts. The programs will be posted on the whiteboard and emailed or texted to you as well!

##### For Those Training at Home or Attending Individual Sessions at the Gym

Your program will be sent to you via text and email, complete with instructions for each workout. From my years of experience as a trainer, I know that having the right program is crucial. I tailor my programs based on where I’m working out and what equipment is available. If you’ve been training with me for a while, you know how much time and effort I put into each session I plan.

#### Training Program Costs (For December ONLY)

If you plan to train in a group:

-  2x a week in class for the month: **$240** per member (60-minute class)
-  3x a week for the month: **$360** per member (60-minute class)

Training at the gym or at home solo:

-  2x a week: **$400** (60-minute sessions)
-  3x a week: **$600** (60-minute sessions)

Let’s work together to make this a fantastic month! The gym will have new equipment, making it a great time to check out a class. Thank you all for your support and commitment to the Ocho Fitness family.

### This Month’s Client Feedback

<blockquote>
"I have been training with Jovani for 13 years, and my wife Karen joined me about 8 years ago. Not only has Jovani helped keep us healthy, but he has also been a positive influence on our marriage! He knows us well and helps us navigate those moments when we’re tired and cranky after a long day. We usually train in the evenings, and the exercise always gives us a mental lift. Does that mean he’s a psychologist too?! 

When I (Mark) first started training with Jovani, I struggled with hip pain. Years later, I ended up having hip replacement surgery. Jovani really helped me survive those years by finding exercises that corrected my gait. After my surgery, he guided me through a quick recovery, and I’ve never felt better.

What sets Jovani apart from other trainers is his genuine care for his clients’ health and lives. He has become a close friend to our family. Each session is personalized for our fitness levels, goals, and what’s happening in our lives. He knows our bodies, understands when to push, and knows when to pull back.

Jovani has high expectations for us and has pushed us to improve over time, which we have. He’s incredibly knowledgeable, with experience working alongside chiropractors in California and Wisconsin, plus a degree in physical training and massage. He understands the human body and knows which muscles to strengthen for better posture, gait, and other concerns.

In the early days, he even pulled out laminated anatomical diagrams to explain what was happening with my muscles and how he planned to address it. He taught us a lot about our bodies so we can manage issues at home when not training. He also advised us on things to avoid.

Above all, Jovani’s strong faith gives him an incredibly positive and hopeful outlook. His enthusiasm and positivity are infectious. We can come in tired and leave happy and laughing. Even on his bad days, you wouldn’t know it. When we arrive to train, he always greets us with a big smile and says, “Ready to go, team!” His demeanor truly reflects his unwavering optimism.

We highly recommend this inspirational workout leader and now, friend. Jovani is passionate about his craft and genuinely cares for his clientele."
