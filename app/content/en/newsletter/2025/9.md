We are up and running remotely now! I hope you have been enjoying your sessions online. Thank you, Mr. Andrew Alba, for helping is set up. We will continue to improve this experience as a team. Again, I would encourage everyone to at least give one class! You have learned so much! Donâ€™t let that go to waste. On a personal note, I have found creative ways to consistently work out. Iâ€™m consistently practicing and trying to better my craft to better serve your individual needs.

Please read the interview I had with my friend Dan Tabalba (Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist):

**Q**: You have been a trainer for many years; you are now a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist, which is the elite certification that any health professional can have. Can you share what three movements you think anyone regardless of age can benefit from?

***A***: Hi Jovani, Thank you for your kind words. I work both in the fitness industry and in the
health profession as a Sports Physical Therapist Assistant. If I could break it down to
the most fundamental level, I would say a squat, hinge and push are the three
movements that would benefit anyone at any age.

- The squat is a fundamental movement whether you are working on standing after an injury or working on power lifting, it will benefit many muscle groups in your legs. In addition, we can add a lot of variations to a squat, which includes, lunge and single leg variation and add jumps if our clients are ready.
- The hinge is another basic movement that can have big implications for our lives. The hinge mostly works on the posterior chain muscles (hamstrings, glutes and back), and it also requires core and upper body stability to perform the movement. The deadlift also requires coordination, balance and body awareness to perform the movement correctly. Like the squat, itâ€™s a movement that we are doing daily, and there are many progressions and/or modifications to challenge our clients and athletes
- The push movement is either a vertical push or shoulder press or horizontal push, which is a bench press. Having a strong upper body is critical for independence, sports and life. Also, who doesnâ€™t want a little bit of tone in their arms for the summer months?

**Q**: have you seen a change in personal training to online coaching? If so, do you think people can still benefit from meeting with a trainer or coach to better the three movements you mentioned?

***A***: Yes, I have seen the addition to online coaching as another pathway to improve our wellness. With the internet and social media and access to all these great professionals, you can get flexibility in scheduling and still get individualized attention a client would want. I firmly believe that if our clients are open to online coaching or in-person coaching, the client can see great results, whichever direction they choose.

**Q**: you also have many years of experience with physical therapy? Can you tell us where you have worked before?

***A***: I have worked at Regions Hospital, TRIA Orthopedic Center and now am currently at the Haus Training powered by Twin Cities Orthopedics.

**Q**:Do you think that most people would benefit from strength training to prevent some of the injuries you have helped people with over the years?

***A***: 100%. In the field I am in where athletes are constantly on the field competing and training, a well-rounded program can help to reduce the risk of injury and spending more time on the sidelines.

Finally, you have known me for a while, and I thank you for your friendship and mentorship over the years. Anything you would like to add to the Ocho Fitness family about my approach toward personal training? Thank you for your time, Dan!

> Jovani has been a good friend and mentor to myself as well. I have learned quite a bit from Jovani and his style of training. I would not hesitate to refer a friend or fellow client to Jovani!

Know that I care about you and value you each of you! Blessings my friends.
