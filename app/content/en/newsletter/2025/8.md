## We are moving to an online platform!

I understand it’s a big change and challenging too. Personal training is still my calling whether in person or online.

My goal is to continue to provide the best training possible. I am working on providing a safe and welcoming environment where you can easily log into your online session. There are many questions you might have. Please [email me with any other questions](/#contact-us).

Thank you to all of you for being part of the family. We have created a wonderful community, and I'm so grateful for each of you. I'm truly blessed.

We have a new space! Thank you to our wonderful friend and host Joan.

Joan will help you guys navigate the gym when I'm gone. Once you learn how to log into your sessions, it should get easier as we go.

Below is a summary of a client who has been training online.

**Q**: Mr. Andrew — You have been training with me online, why do you train online?

***A***: There are a lot of reasons I’ve stuck with online training, but the biggest one for me is convenience. I have a small home setup with some basic equipment, and it just makes sense to get the most out of it. I can jump into a session without needing to drive to a gym or wait around for machines. Plus, I still get the same top-notch coaching and feedback—yes, including the “squeeze your glutes on the way up, Mr. Andrew!” reminders. Training online lets me work out on my schedule, in my space, and still get the same accountability and results.

**Q**: I know people might be asking why don’t you just hire a trainer that you can meet in person?

***A***: Fair question, and actually, I have worked with an in-person trainer before and had a good experience. But training online with Jovani has been just as great, if not better in some ways. Even though I don’t have access to a full gym setup, Jovani is incredibly creative and makes the most of what I do have. We’ve built workouts around dumbbells, fitness ball, heavy-bag, and bodyweight, and it’s been super effective. Plus, I always felt a little awkward having a trainer set up and tear down my weights in person—online, I’m in my own zone and it just feels more natural.

**Q**: You work for an online company that offers personal training, how does Ocho Fitness approach differ?

***A***: One word: connection. The company I work for offers great training with personalized workout and nutrition plans, but Ocho Fitness takes things to a whole different level when it comes to that human connection. When I train with Jovani, we’re not just checking boxes on a workout plan—we’re catching up on life, talking about our families, and actually building a relationship. It’s not just a transaction; it’s time I look forward to. I might not get a structured weekly meal plan, but I get something more valuable: personalized attention, encouragement, and someone in my corner cheering me on every step of the way.

So, I welcome you to try and continue to train! With the progress you have made and the movements you have learned, I am confident our sessions will continue to be positive. 

A big hug from me. Love you and Thank you.
