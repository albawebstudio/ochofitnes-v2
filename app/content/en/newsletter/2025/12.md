<div style="text-align: center;">Merry Christmas, <strong>Ocho Fitness</strong> family!</div>

I hope you've seen over the years how much family means to me. Thank you for being part of mine and for letting me be part of yours. I look forward to next year — more memories, more success stories, more savages made!

### A Note From Me

I had to make the painful decision to return to Mexico voluntarily so I could continue the long, slow, and expensive process of becoming a U.S. citizen. Leaving my kids, my business, and my life behind was the hardest thing I've ever done. I felt powerless, sad, and empty, but I knew it was what I needed to do to make things right for my future and for my family. I arrived here carrying anger and confusion — how could this be happening, and why now? But I didn't have the space to cry or vent or process it. I was supposed to be happy to be back in my country, but not like this. So I hardened my emotions just to make each day tolerable.

I know the pain and frustration my kids feel not having me home. Phone and video calls can'treplace being there I learned from not having a father myself that I wanted to always be present for my kids. I went to their events. I cooked for them. I trained them. We went grocery shopping together. We had movie nights. We ran and walked together. We took meaningful vacations. I got the girls ready for school and picked them up when I could. I watched them get o the bus while I was working. They met all my clients. God allowed me to provide for all my kids and still made time for them every day.

That's why it's hard for us to be apart — because we were a team.

And now… it's just me.

#### I'll End With This

> I believe in a righteous God.
> He clears my path and is a lamp unto my feet, so I don't stumble.
> So today… it is well with my soul.
> I've reset my stance. Stay savage!

### How Exercise Has Changed Lives

This month, I asked people to share how exercise has impacted them. Here's what they said:

<blockquote>
“Exercise has helped me in so many ways. If I had to pick one or two: I'm happier, and for the first time in my life I care more about how my body feels than how it looks — which is HUGE! It also helps me eat and sleep better.”

<blockquote>
“I started working with Jovani after six months of PT from an injury. His knowledge of anatomy and kinesiology is impressive. Now I am recovered, strong, and getting stronger. I'm more confident in my body and able to live more fully. His training sessions are like gold. What keeps the hard work fun, however, is Jovani's smiling, kind, encouraging manner. And that is like sunshine.”

<blockquote>
“Jovani is a talented trainer and coach, and also a good, kind, and patient human. We feel blessed to have found him two years ago. He individualizes every plan, and his clients include a wide range of abilities, ages, and fitness levels. He carefully monitors form and progress. At 71, I may be the fittest I've been since age 20 — maybe even 12!”

<blockquote>
“My job has a high burnout rate and was damaging my health. My wife “made me” go to Jovani because of my weight, blood pressure, and lifestyle. Years later, I'm convinced she saved me from a stroke or heart attack. I'm not the fittest client, but I give it my all twice a week. Jovani has become a true friend. Training has clearly improved my life.”
