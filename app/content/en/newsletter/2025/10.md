### Personal update

I turn 40 on October 3rd — my first birthday without my kids since becoming a papa. My
heart is heavy. Three months away from home feels like forever, and thinking about how
much longer I’ll be here can drown me with frustration.

So today, I focus on what I can control. God is with me. My Ocho Fitness family is with me.
And my kids are always with me in spirit.

No matter our setbacks, injuries, or time off — we keep going. We find and make a way.
That’s why I believe a trainer makes all the difference. I’m here to help you keep moving
when you feel like stopping and remind you that you can do more than you think.

### October Feedback Spotlight

<blockquote>
“I’ve been training with Jovani for the past 4 years. He’s incredibly knowledgeable, patient,
experienced, and encouraging. Most importantly, he truly cares. I wasn’t sure I could gain
muscle and strength at my age, but he believed for me until I believed too. Now I’m stronger
than ever, and grateful to still have his training in my life.”

### This Month we have a client testimony: My brother.

This month’s testimony is personal.

My brother was diagnosed with severe ulcerative colitis. When I was still in the U.S., he
ended up in the hospital. His condition was tough, and here in Mexico the resources are
limited. The doctor’s advice was simple: Until he qualified for the right medicine, he had to
eat well and exercise.

When I moved here, I was able to live with him and make sure he stayed consistent. We
trained at least 4 days a week. I pushed him when he felt like giving up, and we adjusted
when things weren’t clicking. He started at 129 lbs. After three months of steady training,
he reached his goal weight of 154 lbs.

More than the number, it gave him a better quality of life. Progress is possible. You don’t
need a trainer living with you 24/7 — but you do need someone in your corner who knows
how to guide you forward. That’s what I’m here for.
