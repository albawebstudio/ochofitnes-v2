Jovani's education and previous experience working with a chiropractor translate to a thorough understanding of the human anatomy when giving messages. He tailors his workouts to our individual needs and accommodates pains, ailments, or issues we may have that week or month. His knowledge of muscle groups and the exercises we need to address our issues is astounding. I was physically a mess when I started with him, and today in my 60's I have much more flexibility and strength. Jovani is a unique and gifted trainer who always has an upbeat and encouraging attitude. If you cannot tell, we highly recommend him!"
